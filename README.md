## Text Processing
- Program that processes employee data to be displayed in a certain manner.
- To run this program, give it the relative path to the csv file holding the data. Respond to any prompts to correct data as indicated.
- In my opinion, Python has some convenient text processing features like *capitalize()* which doesn't require the programmer to check how the string is already capitalized; it just spits out the string in a certain format. The disadvantage to these kinds of features is that they lack flexibility. For instance, if I wanted to convert a string into camel case, I would need to use a lot more creativity.
- This was my first Python program so I learned a lot. I found a common way to start a Python program with a system argument, I gained experience in making classes and functions, and I learned how to create and use pickle files. I also got a review in how to use a regex and they seem more approachable than I remembered since the regexes used here were fairly basic and I had a guide in front of me.
